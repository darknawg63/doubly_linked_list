# Data Structures: Doubly Linked Lists
This practice code is based on the course [example link](https://www.youtube.com/usr/mycodeschool/ "Strong programming foundations")."Strong programming foundations".

I would strongly recommend this course to any aspiring programmer seeking to get in depth with
the C programming language. The lectures on pointers are exceptionally well presented.
