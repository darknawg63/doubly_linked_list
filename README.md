# Data Structures: Doubly Linked Lists

This practice code is based on the course ["Strong programming foundations"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEEsT7DkdVO_fkrBw0OTrA)
by [mycodeschool.com](http://www.mycodeschool.com/).

I would strongly recommend this course to any aspiring programmer seeking to get in depth with
the C programming language. The lectures on pointers are exceptionally well presented.
